## UDP based Python Project

This project is a team project that will run a laser tag game, it will run with each character having a gun, body armour, as well as a helmet. There will be two teams red and green. The gun will be able to shoot the helmet or armour of the other team for points, as well as a tower, and the game will run for 6 minutes.
